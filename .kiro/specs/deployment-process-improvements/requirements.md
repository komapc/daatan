# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the DAATAN deployment process to ensure higher quality releases, better testing practices, and more reliable deployments. The improvements focus on local verification before staging deployment, ensuring authentication functionality works in staging, implementing automatic version incrementation, and establishing deployment monitoring practices.

## Glossary

- **Deployment_System**: The automated CI/CD pipeline and manual deployment processes used to deploy DAATAN to staging and production environments
- **Local_Environment**: The developer's local machine where code changes are developed and initially tested
- **Staging_Environment**: The pre-production environment at staging.daatan.com used for final verification before production deployment
- **Production_Environment**: The live production environment at daatan.com serving end users
- **Authentication_Service**: The NextAuth-based authentication system using Google OAuth for user login
- **Version_Number**: The semantic version identifier in package.json following the format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- **Health_Check**: The API endpoint at /api/health that returns service status and version information
- **Deployment_Monitor**: The process of observing deployment progress and verifying successful completion

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify my changes locally before merging to staging, so that I can catch issues early and prevent broken deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer completes code changes, THE Deployment_System SHALL provide a pre-merge verification checklist that includes local build verification, local test execution, and local functionality testing
2. THE Deployment_System SHALL enforce that all automated tests pass locally before code can be merged to the main branch
3. THE Deployment_System SHALL require that the local build completes successfully without errors before code can be merged to the main branch
4. WHERE the developer has made authentication-related changes, THE Deployment_System SHALL require manual verification of authentication flows in the Local_Environment before merge
5. THE Deployment_System SHALL provide clear documentation on how to run the complete verification suite locally

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want authentication to work reliably in staging, so that I can properly test user flows before deploying to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Staging_Environment is deployed, THE Authentication_Service SHALL successfully authenticate users using Google OAuth
2. THE Authentication_Service SHALL maintain valid OAuth credentials and callback URLs configured for the Staging_Environment
3. WHEN a user attempts to sign in on staging, THE Authentication_Service SHALL complete the authentication flow without errors
4. THE Deployment_System SHALL include automated verification of Authentication_Service functionality as part of staging deployment validation
5. IF the Authentication_Service fails health checks in the Staging_Environment, THEN THE Deployment_System SHALL alert the development team and prevent promotion to production

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the version number to increment automatically with each deployment, so that I can track releases without manual version management overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is merged to the main branch, THE Deployment_System SHALL automatically increment the Version_Number in package.json following semantic versioning rules
2. THE Deployment_System SHALL create a git tag with the new Version_Number after successful staging deployment
3. THE Deployment_System SHALL update the Health_Check endpoint to return the current Version_Number
4. THE Deployment_System SHALL maintain a changelog or release notes that correspond to each Version_Number increment
5. WHERE a deployment is a hotfix or patch, THE Deployment_System SHALL increment the PATCH version number

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor deployments in real-time, so that I can quickly identify and respond to deployment issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deployment starts, THE Deployment_Monitor SHALL provide real-time visibility into deployment progress through logs and status updates
2. THE Deployment_Monitor SHALL verify that the Health_Check endpoint returns a successful response within 2 minutes of deployment completion
3. THE Deployment_Monitor SHALL verify that the deployed Version_Number matches the expected version from package.json
4. IF the Health_Check fails or returns an incorrect version, THEN THE Deployment_Monitor SHALL trigger an alert and provide rollback instructions
5. THE Deployment_Monitor SHALL track and display key deployment metrics including deployment duration, health check response time, and error rates for 30 minutes post-deployment
