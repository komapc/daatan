## TL;DR

```bash
# 1. Local sanity
npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build

# 2. Deploy to staging — push to main
git push origin main

# 3. Deploy to production — tag and push
./scripts/release.sh        # interactive; bumps version, tags, pushes

# 4. Verify
curl https://staging.daatan.com/api/health
curl https://daatan.com/api/health
```

## Everything else

See [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for the full CI/CD
pipeline, blue-green flow, ECR tags, IAM / SSM specifics, secrets
bootstrap (`fetch-secrets.sh`), and manual / emergency operations. See
[`docs/ROLLBACK.md`](./docs/ROLLBACK.md) for rollback procedures.
