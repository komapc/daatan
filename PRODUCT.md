# DAATAN Product Documentation

> Product vision, features, and roadmap for the reputation-based prediction platform.
> Last updated: January 2026

---

## Executive Summary

DAATAN is a reputation-based platform that enables users to test their understanding and predictions on news, politics, and current affairs — without money, with long-term accuracy measurement.

**The product doesn't measure profit — it measures understanding.**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Product Type | Reputation-based prediction platform |
| Target Market | Israel-first launch, expanding globally |
| Monetization | None (no real money involved) |
| Core Metric | Accuracy over time |

---

## Vision Statement

> "Prove you were right — without shouting into the void."

DAATAN creates a space where authority is earned through accuracy, not exposure. Users build long-term reputation by making testable predictions and being held accountable for their track record.

---

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- Heavy news consumers
- People with opinions on politics and current affairs
- People who enjoy debates, commentary, and reality analysis

### Secondary Users
- Journalists and commentators
- Independent "experts"
- People who want to build authority through accuracy, not exposure

---

## What DAATAN Is NOT

| ❌ Not This | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| Gambling platform | No real money, no cash-out |
| Trading arena | No financial incentives |
| Real-money product | Reputation only |
| Consequence-free game | Every prediction affects track record |
| Engagement-first platform | Accuracy over engagement |

---

## Core Principles

### DO
- Measure accuracy over time
- Preserve track record permanently
- Turn statements into testable predictions
- Enable building authority through results
- Use gamification that serves measurement

### DON'T
- Reward noise over accuracy
- Allow gimmicks without consequences
- Prefer charisma over results
- Involve money or financial incentives

---

## Feature Fit Framework

Every feature must pass ALL checks before implementation:

1. ✅ Does it support long-term accuracy measurement?
2. ✅ Does it preserve or build track record?
3. ✅ Does it avoid financial incentives?
4. ✅ Does it serve measurement over engagement?
5. ✅ Is authority earned, not bought?

**If any check fails → out of scope.**

## Core Concepts

### Reputation Score (RS)
A user's long-term credibility/accuracy score based on past resolved predictions. Updates over time in an ELO-like way (expected outcome vs. actual outcome). Can increase or decrease (including becoming negative).

### Confidence Units (CU)
A limited per-period budget of "confidence" a user can allocate across predictions. CU represent intensity/conviction but:
- Have no monetary value
- Cannot be transferred
- Cannot be bought

### Prediction Weight
The influence/strength of a specific prediction in scoring/visibility calculations.

**Formula:** `Weight = RS × CU`

## Prediction System

### Prediction Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Binary | Will happen / Won't happen | "Bitcoin will exceed $100k by Dec 2026" |
| Multiple Choice | One option out of N | "Who will win the election: A, B, or C?" |
| Numeric Threshold | Metric crosses a value | "Unemployment will drop below 5%" |

### Prediction Lifecycle

```
[News Anchor] → [Draft] → [Define Outcome] → [Commit CU] → [Active] → [Resolution]
```

1. **Select News Anchor** — Pick a news story to attach the prediction to
2. **Write Prediction** — Create a testable forecast statement
3. **Define Outcome** — Choose type (binary/MC/numeric) and deadline
4. **Commit CU** — Allocate confidence units and publish
5. **Resolution** — System/moderator resolves based on evidence

### Resolution Outcomes

| Outcome | Description | CU Effect | RS Effect |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Correct | Prediction happened | Unlock | Changes (calculated) |
| Wrong | Prediction did not happen | Unlock | Changes (calculated) |
| Void | Canceled/invalidated | Refund | No change |
| Unresolvable | Cannot be determined | Unlock | No change |
