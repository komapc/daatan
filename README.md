## What Is DAaTAn?

DAaTAn is a reputation-based product that enables testing understanding and forecasts on news, politics, and current affairs — **without money**, with long-term accuracy measurement.

**The product doesn't measure profit — it measures understanding.**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Scripts

### Development
```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run lint       # Run linter
npm run typecheck  # Type check
npm test           # Run unit tests
```

### Operations
```bash
./scripts/check.sh    # Quick health check (up/down)
./scripts/status.sh   # Full status (health, version, latency)
./scripts/release.sh  # Create version tag and release
```

### Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to staging (automatic on push to main)
git push origin main

# Deploy to production (create version tag)
./scripts/release.sh
# Or manually:
git tag v1.1.1
git push origin v1.1.1
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Local dev:** `npm run dev`.
2. **Commit:** a husky pre-commit hook runs `scripts/check-version-bump.sh` and `lint-staged` (ESLint `--fix` on staged TS/TSX).
3. **Push:** a husky pre-push hook runs `tsc --noEmit` (typecheck) and `vitest run --changed` (tests related to changed files; integration tests excluded).
4. **Deploy staging:** push to `main`.
5. **Deploy production:** run `./scripts/release.sh` to tag `vX.Y.Z` and create a GitHub release.
