# TODO.md - Task Queue

## Up Next

### P0 - Critical

- [x] **Merge bot PRs** — PR #325, #326, #327, #328 merged.
- [ ] **Apply migrations on production** — run `npx prisma migrate deploy` on production server.

### P1 - High Priority

- [ ] **Implement "Scoring rule"** (e.g. Brier score)

- [ ] **Bot: Prompt management & Staging-to-Prod Transfer (Option 2)** — define bots in code (`src/agents/bots/*.json` or `.ts`) as the ultimate source of truth. Server syncs DB from code on startup.  
  1. Admin UI is still a testing sandbox.
  2. Overrides in UI become easily exportable via an "Export as Code" button.
  3. Transferring to production means committing that JSON export to Git, getting PR review/history, and letting CI/CD sync the prod DB automatically.

### P2 - Medium Priority

- [ ] **Notifications system** (unified) — Remaining:
  - [ ] Email notifications (pick provider: SES, Resend, or Postmark)
  - [ ] Comment `@mentions`: parse `@username` in comment text, resolve to user, trigger `MENTION` notification

- [ ] **i18n: Wire translations into all components** — `messages/en.json` and `messages/he.json` both exist with ~103 keys and matching structure. However, many components still use hardcoded English strings instead of `useTranslations()`. Need to audit all UI text and replace with translation keys. Priority: navigation, buttons, form labels, error messages. *(✅ Nav and Settings wired. Still needs forms and error messages).*

- [ ] **i18n: Auto-translate user content** — automatic translation of user-generated forecasts, comments. Requires: translation API (Google Translate / DeepL), caching translated content, language detection, UI toggle for original vs translated text.

- [ ] **Infra: Separate Terraform state per environment** — currently both prod and staging share the same backend key (`prod/terraform.tfstate` in `main.tf`). Running `terraform apply -var-file=staging.tfvars` operates against the prod state. Fix: use Terraform workspaces or separate backend keys per environment. Requires careful `terraform state` migration. Do in a dedicated session with no concurrent changes.

- [ ] **CI/CD: Create `version-bump.yml` workflow** — no workflow exists, but `.husky/pre-commit` references `./scripts/check-version-bump.sh`. Either create the workflow and script, or remove the stale husky reference.

### P3 - Low Priority

- [ ] **Express Forecast: Polish** — add save-as-draft (persist to DB with `status: DRAFT`), regenerate button (re-call LLM with same prompt), inline field editing on review screen (edit title, resolution date, context before finalizing)

- [ ] **Express Forecast: Edit options** — on the express review screen, allow editing/removing/adding generated options before finalizing. Currently options are generated by LLM and accepted as-is.

- [ ] **Manual Forecast: Visual improvements** — enhance UI/UX of manual prediction creation flow. Current flow is functional but plain.

- [ ] **Express Forecast: Numeric threshold support** — e.g., "Bitcoin price above $100K by end of year". LLM generates numeric threshold options (ranges/buckets). Requires: `NUMERIC_THRESHOLD` outcome type handling in prompt, option generation, and resolution logic.

- [ ] **Express Forecast: Advanced types** — order predictions (rank outcomes), date-based (when will X happen), conditional (if X then Y). Each requires LLM prompt engineering + UI + resolution logic. Low priority until core types are solid.

- [ ] **Security: Env var validation at startup** — `GEMINI_API_KEY` only logs a warning if missing at init (`src/lib/llm/index.ts` line 10), `SERPER_API_KEY` only checked at request time (`src/lib/utils/webSearch.ts`). Add a startup validation step (e.g., in `instrumentation.ts` or a custom server init) that fails fast if required env vars are missing.

- [ ] **Security: Enforce CSP headers** — CSP is currently `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` on staging/prod. Review browser console for violations, then change to `Content-Security-Policy` in `nginx-ssl.conf` and `nginx-staging-ssl.conf`. Tests exist in `__tests__/config/nginx-security-headers.test.ts`.

- [ ] **Infra: Optimize CI/CD Deployment Pipeline** — SSM polling timeouts (10min) and pre-deployment health checks already exist. Remaining:
  - [ ] Decouple Staging/Production deployments where safe (currently sequential via `needs: build`)
  - [ ] Implement build-caching for Next.js / Docker layer caching to speed up ECR image creation

- [ ] **Profile: Custom avatar upload** — S3 storage, new `avatarUrl` field on User model, upload UI on profile/settings page. Spec ready. Consider: image resizing (Sharp), max file size, accepted formats (JPEG/PNG/WebP).

- [ ] **Testing: Missing unit test coverage** — notable gaps found in code review:
  - `updateCommitment` / `removeCommitment` — zero test coverage (CU delta logic untested)
  - Admin routes (`/api/admin/forecasts`, `users`, `comments`) — no tests at all
  - Slug collision race condition (P2002 error path) — untested
  - Concurrent first-commitment race (`isFirstCommitment` / `lockedAt` logic) — untested

- [ ] **Testing: E2E tests** (Playwright) — no E2E tests exist. Priority flows: login, create forecast (express + manual), commit to forecast, comment, admin resolution. Set up Playwright config, CI integration, test database seeding.

- [ ] **About Window** — add an "About" modal/page accessible from settings or sidebar. Show: app version (from `/api/health`), git commit, build date, credits/attribution, link to GitHub repo.

### Verify / Check Later

- [ ] **Notifications: Validate Telegram notifications** — verify that Telegram notifications fire correctly on all 4 trigger points (publish, commit, comment, resolve) in both staging and production. Bot: @ScoopPredictBot (prod), @DaatanClawBot (staging). Channel: @ScoopPredict.

- [ ] **SEO: Slugs** — `Prediction` model has a `slug` field (optional, unique) and the API route (`/api/forecasts/[id]/route.ts`) supports lookup by both ID and slug. But the frontend route is `/forecasts/[id]/` and always uses numeric IDs in URLs. To use slugs: update `Link` hrefs to use `slug` instead of `id`, add slug generation on prediction creation, handle slug-based routing in the page component.

- [ ] **SEO: Server-render home feed** — `src/app/page.tsx` wraps `FeedClient` (a `'use client'` component) that fetches via `useEffect`. No SSR — content invisible to crawlers on initial load. To fix: convert to Server Component with server-side data fetch, or use React Server Components with streaming.

### Upgrades (evaluate when ready)

- [ ] **Next.js 15** — when stable + LTS. App Router improvements, React 19 features, Turbopack stable.
- [ ] **Auth.js v5** — successor to NextAuth.js 4. Breaking changes (new config format, middleware-based auth), needs migration plan.
- [ ] **Turbopack** — replace webpack when stable for production builds. Already available in Next.js dev mode.
- [ ] **Drizzle ORM** — evaluate as Prisma alternative (lighter runtime, faster queries, SQL-first API). Major migration effort.
