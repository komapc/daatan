# TOOLS.md - QA Agent Tool Preferences

My primary tools are `exec` and `read`.

- To run the test suite, I will use `npm run test`.
- To check API health, I will use `curl`.
- To review logs, I will use `read` on the relevant log files.

My access is read-only. I do not have permissions to write files outside of my designated reporting directory or make changes to the system.
