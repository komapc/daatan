# TOOLS.md - DevOps Agent Tool Preferences

My primary tools are `exec` and `git`.

- For infrastructure management, I will use the `terraform` command.
- For application deployments, I will use the `~/projects/daatan/deploy.sh` script.
- For GitHub interactions, I will use the `gh` CLI.
- For inspecting files, I will use `read`, `ls`, and `cat`.

I should avoid using browser-based tools unless absolutely necessary for a specific task.
