## 1. What Is DAATAN?

**One sentence:**
> DAATAN is a reputation-based product that enables testing understanding and predictions on news, politics, and current affairs — without money, with long-term accuracy measurement.

**The product doesn't measure profit — it measures understanding.**

---

## 2. Who Is It For?

### Primary Audience (Israel-first launch)
- Heavy news consumers
- People with opinions on politics and current affairs
- People who enjoy debates, commentary, and reality analysis

### Secondary Audience
- Journalists and commentators
- Independent "experts"
- People who want to build authority through accuracy, not exposure

---

## 3. What DAATAN Is NOT

DAATAN is **not**:
- A gambling platform
- A trading arena
- A real-money product
- A consequence-free game
- A place to "guess and forget"

We don't have:
- Cash or real money
- Cash-out functionality
- Capital advantage (can't buy better odds)
- Bots or algorithmic trading

---

## 4. Core Principles

### DO
- Measure accuracy over time
- Preserve track record
- Turn statements into testable predictions
- Enable building authority through results
- Use gamification that serves measurement

### DON'T
- Reward noise over accuracy
- Allow gimmicks without consequences
- Prefer charisma over results
- Involve money or financial incentives

---

## 5. Layer Hierarchy

### Core Layer: Accountability & Reputation (Non-Negotiable)
- Cumulative reputation score
- Permanent track record
- Every prediction affects the future
- Authority is built, not bought

### Wrapper Layer: Gamified / Engaging News
- Short-term predictions
- Competitions
- "Beat the expert"
- Interactive elements

> **The game serves measurement. Not the other way around.**

---

## 6. Out of Scope (For Now)

- Real-money trading
- Buying/selling reputation
- Momentary leaderboards without cumulative meaning
- Conspiracy/provocative content for engagement
- Any feature that doesn't pass Feature Fit Framework

---

## 7. Feature Fit Framework

Before adding any feature, it must pass all checks:

1. Does it support long-term accuracy measurement?
2. Does it preserve or build track record?
3. Does it avoid financial incentives?
4. Does it serve measurement over engagement?
5. Is authority earned, not bought?

**If a feature fails any check → out of scope.**
