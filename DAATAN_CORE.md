# DAATAN Core

1. Vision & IdentityName: DAATAN (Hebrew/Arabic root for "Knowledge/Data-driven")Slogan: "Prove you were right — without shouting into the void."Core Mission: Turning passive news consumption into a verifiable, gamified track record of accuracy.The "DAATAN" PhilosophyAccountability: "Следить за базаром." No deleted takes. Every prediction is a permanent part of your digital legacy.Interactivity over Doomscrolling: Transitioning the user from a passive reader to an active forecaster.Three Pillars of Content: 1.  Facts: Unbiased gist of the news.2.  Analytics: Expert breakdown.3.  Opinions: Personal takes (the fuel for predictions).2. Technical Migration Strategy (Base44 $\rightarrow$ Manual)The goal is to move from the managed Base44 infrastructure to a scalable, developer-owned stack.Frontend: React / Next.js (for SEO and fast rendering of news items).Backend: Node.js / Supabase (Auth + PostgreSQL database).AI Orchestration: Cursor/Claude for code generation; Gemini Pro/Claude API for LLM features.Hosting: AWS (EC2/Amplify) + GitHub Actions for CI/CD.3. Product Features & LogicA. The Prediction Engine (The "Hunch")LLM-Assisted Phrasing: The system suggests binary (Yes/No) outcomes from news text.Confidence Slider: Users choose a probability (50%–100%).Scoring: Implementation of the Brier Score to measure calibration.$$B = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^{N} (f_t - o_t)^2$$(Where $f_t$ is the forecast probability and $o_t$ is the actual outcome 0 or 1).B. The Social & Authority LayerResolved Bets Hub: The primary destination to see "Who was right."Identity: Persistent pseudonymous accounts. You don't need a real name, but you need a real history.Challenges: Ability to "Invite a Friend" or "Challenge an Expert" to a specific bet.C. The Widget (The Distribution Hook)An embeddable JS snippet for external bloggers/publishers.Captures high-intent users directly on the news page.4. Automated Adjudication LogicTo avoid manual overhead, DAATAN uses an AI Evidence Pipeline:Collection: On the resolution date, the system queries news APIs (Perplexity/Exa) for specific keywords.Processing: LLM analyzes the top 5 sources.Verdict: * Success/Failure: High confidence resolution.Escalation: If sources are contradictory, the bet is moved to a "Human Review" queue.5. Implementation Roadmap (Next 90 Days)PhaseMilestoneCursor/IDE TasksPhase 1Database SchemaDefine users, bets, outcomes, and reputation tables in SQL.Phase 2Core UIBuild the "Prediction Card" component and "News Feed."Phase 3Logic LayerImplement Brier score math and Auth migration from Base44.Phase 4AI IntegrationConnect the "Resolution Engine" to search APIs.6. Development Guidelines for Claude/CursorNaming Conventions: Use camelCase for JS/TS; snake_case for PostgreSQL.Modularity: Keep the "Scoring Logic" separate from the "UI Components" for easy testing.Security: Ensure "Bot Passwords" and API keys are managed via .env and never hardcoded.
