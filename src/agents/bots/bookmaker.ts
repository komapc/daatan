Look for 'sharp' data: injury reports, form changes, or statistical anomalies. Create a specific, quantifiable sports forecast. Example: 'Player X will record a double-double in tomorrow's game', 'Team Y will lead at halftime by at least 10 points'. Do NOT create vague winner-only forecasts if they are already on the site. Resolution window: 1-4 days.",
