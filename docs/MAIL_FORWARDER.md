# Mail Forwarder

Incoming email for `@daatan.com` is received by AWS SES and forwarded to personal Gmail addresses via a Lambda function.

## Architecture

```
Sender → SES inbound (eu-central-1) → S3 (raw email stored)
                                     → Lambda (daatan-mail-forwarder-prod)
                                           ↓
                                     SES outbound → Gmail
```

**Terraform**: `terraform/ses.tf`  
**Lambda source**: `infra/mail-forwarder/index.mjs`

## Routing

| Recipient | Forwarded to |
|-----------|-------------|
| `mark@daatan.com` | `komapc@gmail.com` |
| `andrey@daatan.com` | `andrey1bar@gmail.com` |
| anything else (`office@`, etc.) | `komapc@gmail.com`, `andrey1bar@gmail.com` (catch-all) |

Configured via Lambda env var `FORWARD_MAPPING` (JSON) and `CATCH_ALL_DESTINATIONS` (comma-separated). Managed in `terraform/ses.tf`.

## What the Lambda does

1. Reads the raw email from S3 (SES stores it there before invoking Lambda).
2. Drops any message addressed to `forwarder@daatan.com` (bounce/DSN loop guard).
3. Rewrites headers:
   - `From:` → `{Original Name} via Daatan <forwarder@daatan.com>`
   - `Reply-To:` → original sender address
   - `To:` → forwarding destination(s)
   - `Return-Path:` → removed (SES adds its own)
4. Sends via SES `SendRawEmail`.

**Important**: The raw email stored in S3 has SES-prepended headers (`Received:`, `X-SES-*`, etc.) in the same header block as the original headers. Do **not** strip everything before the first blank line — that would discard all headers and cause Gmail to reject the email with "From header is missing". Strip only specific unwanted headers by name if needed.

## Sending from daatan.com addresses (Gmail SMTP)

Both Mark and Andrey can send outbound email from their `@daatan.com` addresses using Gmail's "Send mail as" feature via SES SMTP.

**SMTP settings** (from `terraform output`):

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| SMTP Server | `email-smtp.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com` |
| Port | `587` (STARTTLS) |
| Username | `terraform output smtp_username_andrey` / `smtp_username_mark` |
| Password | `terraform output smtp_password_andrey` / `smtp_password_mark` |

**IAM users**: `terraform/iam_smtp.tf` — `ses-smtp-mark-*` and `ses-smtp-andrey-*`, both have `ses:SendRawEmail` on `*`.

**Setup steps** (Gmail):
1. Gmail Settings → Accounts and Import → Send mail as → Add another email address
2. Enter the `@daatan.com` address, uncheck "Treat as alias"
3. Enter SMTP settings above
4. Click through the verification email that arrives in your inbox

## Known issues / history

| Date | Issue | Fix |
|------|-------|-----|
| 2026-04-07 | PR #601 stripped all headers by slicing at first `\r\n\r\n`, causing "From header is missing" Gmail rejection | PR #605: removed the strip block entirely |
| 2026-04-07 | Bounce loop: DSNs sent to `forwarder@daatan.com` were re-forwarded, causing cascades | PR #605: drop messages whose destination == `VERIFIED_FROM` |
| 2026-04-07 | `Return-Path:` replaced with `""` left a leading blank line, causing all headers to appear as email body in Gmail | Commit on `infra/sync-terraform-drift`: regex now includes `\r?\n` to remove the entire line |

## Deploying changes

The Lambda is managed by Terraform. After editing `infra/mail-forwarder/index.mjs`:

```bash
cd terraform
terraform apply -target=aws_lambda_function.forwarder
```

For urgent hotfixes, deploy directly then sync Terraform state:
```bash
cd infra/mail-forwarder
zip -j lambda.zip index.mjs
aws lambda update-function-code --function-name daatan-mail-forwarder-prod --zip-file fileb://lambda.zip
# Then run terraform apply to sync state hash
```

## Monitoring

CloudWatch log group: `/aws/lambda/daatan-mail-forwarder-prod`

Useful filter patterns:
- `"Processing message"` — all invocations with recipient
- `"Email forwarded"` — successful forwards
- `"Failed to forward"` — errors
- `"Dropping bounce"` — suppressed DSN loops
