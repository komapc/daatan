# Analytics

Google Analytics 4 with GDPR/CCPA consent mode. Data is only sent after explicit user acceptance; declining keeps the site fully functional.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Where set | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID_PROD` | EC2 `.env` | Production GA4 property (`G-XZWVJM9KH4`) |
| `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID_STAGING` | EC2 `.env` | Staging GA4 property (`G-Z4XXM7GYHW`) |
| `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` | docker-compose (mapped from above) | What the app container reads |

`docker-compose.prod.yml` maps `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID_PROD` → `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`; same pattern for staging. The app reads it at render time in `src/app/layout.tsx` and passes it as a prop to `GoogleAnalytics`.

## Key files

- `src/components/GoogleAnalytics.tsx` — renders the three GA scripts
- `src/components/CookieConsent.tsx` — GDPR banner; reads/writes `daatan_analytics_consent` in localStorage
- `src/components/AnalyticsUserSync.tsx` — associates the authenticated user ID with the GA session via `gtag('set', { user_id })`
- `src/lib/analytics.ts` — `trackEvent()` wrapper + named events (`analytics.forecastCreated`, etc.)

## Consent flow

1. **Page load** — the consent script runs `beforeInteractive` (injected into `<head>`, blocks parse). It reads `localStorage` synchronously:
   - Key present and `'granted'` → sets `analytics_storage: 'granted'` immediately
   - Key present and `'denied'` → sets `analytics_storage: 'denied'` immediately, no wait
   - Key absent (new visitor) → sets `analytics_storage: 'denied'` with `wait_for_update: 500`
2. **GA library** loads `afterInteractive` and processes the already-established consent state.
3. **New visitor** — `CookieConsent` banner appears. Accept → `gtag('consent', 'update', { analytics_storage: 'granted' })` + persists to localStorage. Decline → persists `'denied'`, banner disappears.
4. **Returning visitor** — consent applied synchronously in step 1; banner never shown again.

The `beforeInteractive` strategy guarantees consent is set before the GA library runs — no race condition is possible.

## Custom events

| Event name | Fired from | Params |
|---|---|---|
| `forecast_created` | `ForecastWizard.tsx` | `outcome_type`, `is_express` |
| `commitment_made` | `CommitmentForm.tsx` | `forecast_id`, `cu_committed` |
| `comment_posted` | `CommentForm.tsx` | `is_reply` |
| `login` | `SignInClient.tsx` | `method` |

All events are no-ops when GA isn't loaded or consent is denied — `trackEvent()` checks `typeof window.gtag === 'function'` before calling.

## GA console setup (required)

**Consent Mode modeling must be enabled** or declined users are invisible in reports entirely (zero data, not estimates).

For each property (`G-XZWVJM9KH4` prod, `G-Z4XXM7GYHW` staging):
> analytics.google.com → Admin → Data collection and modification → Data collection → **Consent mode** → Enable

## Verifying GA is working

1. Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage → delete `daatan_analytics_consent`
2. Reload the page and accept the cookie banner
3. DevTools → Network → filter `google-analytics`
4. Click the `g/collect` request — confirm `gcs=G111` in query params (both consents granted)

`gcs=G100` means consent is still denied — check that `applyConsent('granted')` is being called and that the consent script is present in the page source.

## Staging vs production

Staging (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV=staging`) adds `debug_mode: true` and an `environment: 'staging'` dimension to GA so staging traffic can be filtered out in reports. The measurement ID is hardcoded in `layout.tsx` for staging; production reads from `process.env.GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`.
